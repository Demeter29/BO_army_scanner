# BO Army Scanner (discontinued!)

BO Army Scanner is a discord bot made for Bannerlord Online clans to keep track of their members army and display statistics about them and about the clan overall.

It was first made for House Galendine but I decided to release it for everyone.

## Discontinued!
As of may 2022, I have abandoned the project because the need for the bot dropped when the devs implemented unit trading and it was less relevant what unit each player had. Because both Bannerlord and Bannerlord Online keeps changing their UI, it's very likely that the bot will break in the future.

## Features

### Scanning
<p> Scan your army by taking a screenshot and the bot will scan it and load into its database</p>

### Guild stats
<p> The bot calculates stats about the guild based on its members who uploaded their army</p>

### Leaderboard
<p> And finally you can make a leaderboard for your clan which can sorted by troop count, max party size, gold or wages</p>
